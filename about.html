The Ministry of Health (MoH) has launched a Centre of Excellence for Cancer Research and Training at the Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital (KUTRRH).

In a statement, the Ministry of Health said that the initiative is a collaboration between Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital, the University of Manchester and the Christie Foundation.

Their aim is to uplift the standard of healthcare in Kenya, through research, workforce training and education of healthcare professionals.

 “The centre is key in ongoing efforts to comprehensively deal with the cancer menace as research findings will help better understand the types of cancers prevalent in Kenya & the Region & how best to manage them,” KUTRRH chair Prof. Olive Mugenda said.


Lord Graham, the Dean of the Faculty of Biology at the University of Manchester said the University of Manchester and the Christie Foundation will support capacity building, especially for clinical services and PET/CT.
